 * A Iterable object that contains the children of each node.
 * <p>Introduced to allow two ways of iterating over the children. A tree might specify positions for its children. If
 * these positions are ordered it may be necessary to know when a position is empty. For example when iterating over a
 * binary tree, the left branch may be empty and for correct iteration order whether or not the root or right node
 * should be returned depends on knowing the left branch is empty.</p>
